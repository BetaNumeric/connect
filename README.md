# Connect

[**Live Demo**](https://betanumeric.github.io/connect/)

Connect is a physics-based drawing puzzle game built with p5.js and Planck.js.  
Draw lines to guide a blue and a yellow-colored ball to collide while navigating platforms, obstacles, and rotating elements.

## Gameplay

Each level starts with two balls placed in different positions. The goal is for the two balls to touch.
Draw a line, and once you release it becomes a shape that is affected by gravity and collisions. Once the first shape is drawn, the timer starts, but the player can keep adding shapes to the game.
Finish with fewer lines and faster times to set better scores.

## Tech Stack

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for rendering and input
- [Planck.js](https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js/) for 2D physics
